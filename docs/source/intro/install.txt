Before you can use Shiva, you'll need to satisfy its requirements and install its dependencies.

Requirements
============

* Ubuntu 16.04 or Mac OS

* Git
* pip (Python Package Installer)


Install Python
==============

Being a Python Web framework, Django requires Python. See
:ref:`faq-python-version-support` for details. Python includes a lightweight
database called SQLite_ so you won't need to set up a database just yet.

.. _sqlite: https://sqlite.org/

Get the latest version of Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/ or with
your operating system's package manager.

You can verify that Python is installed by typing ``python`` from your shell;
you should see something like::

    Python 3.x.y
    [GCC 4.x] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
