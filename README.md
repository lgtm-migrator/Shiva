# Shiva

Deep reinforcement/imitation learning pipeline leveraging population based training for continuous and discrete action spaces. Adaptable to game environments by creating a game specific environment wrapper.

Get started with the Installation and then thru the Quickstart to see how to run a session. The Tutorial section goes in more details about Shiva to familiarize with it's components and then be able to extend new algorithms.
