# basically import shiva
import Meta_Learner

# declare the path
ini_path = "*/Initializers"


# then you pass the path to configs to the instance of the metalearner
meta = Meta_Learner(ini_path)


# then you can have an overview of all the different learners running at same time
# maybe we can make a gui or do something
# maybe we can set up tensorboard here with methods from meta
